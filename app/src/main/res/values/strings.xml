These codes are set to mimic the behavior of the official 3rd party app. If the codes match your real country (may be detected by your IP address) then your requests will look the most inconspicuous.

  <string name="settings_screen_db_filtering">Database filtering</string>
  <string name="db_filtering_info">Explanation</string>
  <string name="db_filtering_info_summary">This feature allows to save storage space by removing some data that is not applicable to you (like numbers belonging to different regions or countries). It doesn\'t affect general app performance (like call blocking). Filtering occurs during the initial database download and during database update. Existing data (downloaded prior to enabling the filtering) may be filtered using the \"Filter the database\" option below. Disabling the feature or changing its parameters doesn\'t restore removed data - you need to re-download the database for that</string>

  <string name="db_filtering_prefixes_to_keep_summary">A comma-separated list of prefixes of numbers to keep. The prefixes should be in the international format (like +1234). E.g., if you only receive calls from numbers starting with +1, put +1 here</string>
  <string name="db_filtering_thorough">Thorough filtering</string>
  <string name="db_filtering_thorough_summary">If enabled, it goes through every block of data and removes numbers not matching the prefixes. Otherwise, it only removes whole unwanted blocks (leaving some unwanted numbers in wanted blocks). It is recommended to leave this on. Required for keeping short numbers</string>
  <string name="db_filtering_keep_short_numbers">Keep short numbers</string>
  <string name="db_filtering_keep_short_numbers_summary">Keep numbers shorter than the specified length regardless of prefixes</string>
